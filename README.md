# TODO and feature ideas
* document what this is
* more filesystem tests
* refactor UI code to be clearer
* keep original provided name for file groups?
* config file?
* other useful things in status bar?
* scrollable lists?
* dynamically sized lists?
* configurable list sizes (probably requires config file to not be a pain)?
* retain deleted state across restarts?
